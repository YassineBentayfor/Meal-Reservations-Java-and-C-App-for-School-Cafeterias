# Meal-Reservations-Java-and-C-App-for-School-Cafeterias
Our team collaborated on a Java app that simulates meal reservation for students in school cafeterias. Our goal was to provide a more efficient alternative to the traditional method of queuing to purchase meal tickets. Our app allows students to conveniently reserve meals and manage their accounts from anywhere at any time, using their mobile devices. Additionally, we've developed a version of the app using C.

Once logged in, students can access their profiles, view their meal reservations and remaining funds, as well as browse the weekly menu and various meal options. The system also includes an admin account for easy management of the application.

We're excited to share our app with the GitHub community and invite you to try it out. We believe it has the potential to enhance the cafeteria experience for students and streamline operations for school administrators.
